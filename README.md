Multi UAV Obstacle Avoidance, Formation-Aware and Communication-Aware Path-finding Algorithm in a Known Environment


This algorithm is for navigating $N$ UAVs  from point $A$ to $B$ in a 2D map with known environment, while satisfying safety, formation, and communication-connectivity constraints. The algorithm modifies the classical A* search to include swarm-specific metrics like formation feasibility and algebraic connectivity.
